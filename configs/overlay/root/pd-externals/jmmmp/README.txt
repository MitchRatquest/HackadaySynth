Abstractions from João Pais

Released under the BSD license (more information in each abstraction).


This package has several base utilities that make coding a bit easier. It is composed of the following abstractions:

array-edit - edit properties of arrays and populate them following several formulas
but - Monochrome bang button
clock - Chronometer with display in seconds
dacm~ - Mono dac~ for lazy people
datei-o - Sends the message "open ../../"
datei-r - Sends the message "read ../../"
datei-w - Sends the message "write ../../"
dsp01 - DSP switch
f+ - Counter with variable increment
gui-edit - edit standard GUI objects fast
lbang - loadbang which can be triggered more often
liner~ - practical implementation of [line~]
liner+~ - practical implementation of signal envelopping
mat~ - Level meter with amplitude control
maat~ - Level meter with amplitude control, stereo
met~ - Level meter with amplitude control (with VU, too CPU expensive for me)
metrum - Metro with GUI
m-i - Automatic conversion of MIDI controller
mk - shows the controller number and MIDI value
oscD - Counts received OSC messages
oscS - Interface for sendOSC
pd-colors - Pd color palettes (Data Structures + Tcl/Tk)
rec-name - Automatic naming for a record/playback engine
sguigot - spigot GUI implementation
sliders - GUI for incoming midi data
snaps~ - snapshot~ GUI implementation
spectrogram~ - Spectrogram with 512 bins resolution
stoppuhr - Chronometer with two layers
tastin - Gate for keyboard input
uhr - Shows the time


It is recomended to use these abstractions with Pd-extended, since I don't keep track of which externals are used. Some abstractions use other ones of this package, so it is also better to have always the whole package in one place.

Non-working or discarded abstractions:

aufnahme~ - Multichannel audio recorder (1 to 8 channels)
bcf2000 - Store and recall presets for Behringer BCF2000
-dsp - replaced by dsp01
datei-l - replaced with datei-o
