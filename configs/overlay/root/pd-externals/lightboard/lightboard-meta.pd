#X text 10 70 DESCRIPTION "Lighting for Pure Data" is an abstractions'
collection for "Pure Data" that aims at emulating a lighting console
controlling DMX systems. Unlike a hardware lighting console \, this
system offers an open API allowing a full control over the lighting
within Pure Data in order to connect light with other media. This also
allows to have complex light movements and behaviours.;
