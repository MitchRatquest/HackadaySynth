#X text 9 71 DESCRIPTION Pure mapping is an objects' collection for
Pure Data. These objects are based on the "Mapping" collection developed
with HC Steiner (which was partly based on La-kitchen lib). But contrary
to the "Mapping" Lib \, the "Pure Mapping" objects do not have any
dependency. So \, they easily work with Pd Vanilla. These objects were
made to facilitate the use of sensors within Pure Data and to create
complex relations between input and output of a dynamic system.;
