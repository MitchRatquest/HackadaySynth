    """Base class for request handlers for SLIP-based communication

    This class is derived from :class:`socketserver.BaseRequestHandler`
    for the purpose of creating TCP server instances
    that can handle incoming SLIP-based connections.

    This base class ensures that the connection
    is wrapped in a SlipSocket, and makes it
    available as :code:`self.request`.
    The original connection is still available as self.request.socket.
    The client address as available as :code:`self.client_address`,
    and the server as :code:`self.server`.

    To implement a specific behaviour, all that
    is needed is to derive a class that
    defines a :meth:`handle` method that uses
    :code:`self.request` to send and receive messages.
