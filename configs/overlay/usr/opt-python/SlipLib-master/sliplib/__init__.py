The :mod:`sliplib` module implements the encoding and decoding
functionality for SLIP packets, as described in :rfc:`1055`.
It defines encoding, decoding, and validation functions,
as well as various classes that can be used to to wrap
the SLIP protocol over different kinds of byte streams.

The SLIP protocol is described in :rfc:`1055` (:title:`A Nonstandard for
Transmission of IP Datagrams over Serial Lines: SLIP`, J. Romkey,
June 1988).  The original purpose of the protocol is
to provide a mechanism to indicate the boundaries of IP packets,
in particular when the IP packets are sent over a connection that
does not provide a framing mechanism, such as serial lines or
dial-up connections.

There is, however, nothing specific to IP in the SLIP protocol.
The protocol describes a generic framing method that can be used for any
type of data that must be transmitted over a (continuous) byte stream.
In fact, the main reason for creating this module
was the need to communicate with a third-party application that
used SLIP over TCP (which is a continuous byte stream)
to frame variable length data structures.

The SLIP protocol uses four special byte values:

=============== ================ =============================================
Byte value      Name             Purpose
=============== ================ =============================================
:code:`0xc0`    :const:`END`     to delimit messages
:code:`0xdb`    :const:`ESC`     to escape :data:`END` or :data:`ESC` bytes in the message
:code:`0xdc`    :const:`ESC_END` the escaped value of the :data:`END` byte
:code:`0xdd`    :const:`ESC_ESC` the escaped value of the :data:`ESC` byte
=============== ================ =============================================

An :const:`END` byte in the message is encoded as the sequence
:code:`ESC+ESC_END` (:code:`b'\\xdb\\xdc'`)
in the slip packet,
and an :const:`ESC` byte  in the message is encoded
as the sequence :code:`ESC+ESC_ESC` (:code:`b'\\xdb\\xdd'`).

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Decoded", "Encoded"

   :code:`b'\\xc0'`, :code:`b'\\xdb\\xdc'`
   :code:`b'\\xdb'`, :code:`b'\\xdb\\xdd'`

As a consequence, an :const:`ESC` byte in an encoded SLIP packet
must always be followed by an :const:`ESC_END` or an :const:`ESC_ESC` byte;
anything else is a protocol error.
