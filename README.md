  <summary>Buildroot configuration</summary> 
  
  
  Buildroot is simpler and takes up less space than yocto. You can get started like this:

```console
make menuconfig
make linux-menuconfig
make uboot-menuconfig
make busybox-menuconfig
```
  
  While in any of those menus, you can use '/' to search for a string, which is insanely helpful and I somehow managed to create the first try of this without it. For years. Its a beautiful feature.
